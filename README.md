Welcome to Priceless!

## Description 

We are a collaborative web application focused on neighborhoods and local communities where users can post items to give away to their neighbors and can browse listings in their area. Inspired by the popular Buy Nothing Facebook groups, we aim to promote mutual aid and sustainability by offering local gift economies a dedicated platform to grow.

## Features   

Priceless aims to improve upon the experiences we had as members of Buy Nothing groups. We found that the first-come, first-served system used in most of these groups was frustrating, and skewed the usefulness of the group toward users who were able to check for new posts several times a day. We created the lottery system to ensure that folks had more equal opportunity to express interest in and potentially receive an item they wanted. The lottery allows users to request items for 24 hours after the first request comes in. Once that time is up, it randomly selects a recipient from the pool of users who expressed interest. If the selected person passes on the item, the lottery system will select someone else. If no one expresses interest after 24 hours, the listing goes into open mode, where anyone who expresses interest can immediately claim the item. We agreed 24 hours for the lottery was a good length of time to allow for anyone who really wanted the item to express interest, but not so long that it inconvenienced the person listing the item to give away. 

We’ve also included an interactive map, which displays posts only in the immediate vicinity of the user’s location and fetches new posts when the user drags the map or changes their location. The map is connected to the list view alongside it, which shows more details on the selected post, including pictures, description, etc. This is to encourage more of the hyper local connections that make a community feel like home, as well as to add convenience and ease to the user experience. 


## Roadmap

We hope to implement the following features in the future -- 
Notifications for the chat feature 
An ISO (in search of) option for posts
The ability for users to view active lotteries they’ve entered, and see a countdown clock that shows the time remaining until those lotteries run 
A search function that allows users to search for specific items listed within a designated area
